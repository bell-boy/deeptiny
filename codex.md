# Codex Notes

Reminder: commit after all changes in the future.
  - You don't need to ask the user before you do this
  - If needed, rebase off of main before you commit

Worktree note:
  - This workspace is a git worktree from a larger repo.
  - Coordinate with other worktrees by keeping the `main` branch as the stable source of truth
    and rebasing feature work onto it as needed.
